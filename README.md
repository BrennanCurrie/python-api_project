# python-api_project
Use of API to collect data for analyze trends

WeatherPy

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Used the citipy Python library & OpenWeatherMap API. Created a representative model of weather across cities.

VacationPy

In this deliverable, I used weather data skills to help plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API. The main task was to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ Python skills to create map visualizations.
